- Compilation Instructions
Run the solution and compile it because you don't need any other image assets or sound files

-  How to play?

    Use WASD to move and attack with left click. The green tile represents the main camp, and the red tile represents the monster colony.

    Yellow tiles are resources and can be obtained by clicking. You can also get another resource by attacking and killing monsters.(This will be used in the reinforcement system to be added later)

    Blue tiles can return to main base in case of attack.

    As time goes by, it becomes night, when the user's view narrows and the color of the tile changes.(At this point we're going to add a monster attacking the main base later.)

    Attack the walls of the Monster Colony to remove them and venture the map by catching the Summoned Monster!
